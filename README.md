# The LiFi-Project Code Examples

This repository contains all code examples for the [LiFi-project](https://lifi.datalit.de/). The LiFi-project introduces important topics of digitalization and programming. It is developed and maintained by [Prof. Dr. Nicolas Meseth](https://www.hs-osnabrueck.de/prof-dr-nicolas-meseth/) at the University of Applied Sciences Osnabr√ºck.

Students are recommended to checkout the repository as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/winf-hsos/LiFi-code.git
```

Working examples for all devices from the LiFi-project live in the `devices` folder. Make sure you replace the empty strings in the `config.yaml` with the UIDs of your personal LiFi hardware prototype.
